# MAGIC # Creating an AutoML Experiment - UI
# MAGIC AutoML can be used both via the user interface and via a Python-based API.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In this demonstration, we're going to develop a baseline model using the user interface.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ##### Objectives
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to AutoML UI
# MAGIC 1. Set up and run an experiment
# MAGIC 1. Evaluate the results
# MAGIC 1. View the best model

# MAGIC ## Classroom Setup
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC First, we'll run the `Classroom-Setup` notebook to set up our environment.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %run "./Includes/Classroom-Setup-UI" $mode=reset

# MAGIC ### Evaluate the Results
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC AutoML will automatically evaluate each of your models. You can view each of these model's results in the experiment page. AutoML will also provide an easy link for you to view the notebook that generated the best model.
